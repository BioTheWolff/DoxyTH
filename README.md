# DoxyTH
DoxyTH stands for Doxygen inline-documentation Translation Helper. This small package aims to provide a 
quick way to generate Doxygen docs in HTML (LaTeX will come later) in different languages easily.

## Setup
### Installation
You first have to install the package.
You can install it automatically via pip
```commandline
pip install doxyth
```

You can also install it by cloning the Github repository (deprecated)

### Setting up the translations folder
In your project directory, create a directory that will contain all the translations.
You can name it however you want, even though a meaningful name like `translations` is still better.

Inside, you have to create a directory with the [ISO 639-1 2-letters code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) 
for the desired language. Directories having more or less than 2 charaters will be ignored by DoxyTH, but unrecognised
2-characters directories will generate warnings.

This is an example layout (and the one I use for the DoxyTH package documentation!)
```ignorelang
<path>\DOXYTH\TRANSLATIONS
├───en
│       doxyth.dthdoc
│       gendoc.dthdoc
│
└───fr
        gendoc.dthdoc
```

In each language directory, you will need to create one (or more) `.dthdoc` files. All files having
another extension will be ignored.

### Layout of a .dthdoc file
Each file follows the current format:
```ignorelang
&doc_id <ID>
"""
<DOCUMENTATION>
"""
```

`ID` is the ID you will put in your code, and `DOCUMENTATION` (everything between the two `"""`) is what will replace
the doclines where this ID is found.

**WARNING**: Be aware that the line breaks are important. The `"""` must be ALONE on their line.

DoxyTH will remove any empty lines between the start of the doclines and the start of your comment 
(same as between the end of your comment and the end of the doclines) to avoid problems when passing the file lines to a 
postprocess.

### In-code documentation
In your code, you can then start to write the `doc_id`s.
If you wish to replace doclines by a translations, put a `doc_id` following this layout:
```python
"""
### &doc_id <PREFIX>:<ID>
"""
```
(For advanced users, the regex pattern is `r"\s*###\s*&doc_id\s*"`)

**WARNING**: Don't forget the prefix! The prefix is the name of the documentation file
the `doc_id` was found in.

Example: If you have a file named `mydocs.dthdoc` which contains a `my_doc_id` ID inside,
The full `doc_id` you need to include in your code is `mydocs:my_doc_id`.

See below under Usage how to deactivate file prefixes, if you wish to do so.

## Running the program
### Usage
This is the usage provided by argparse itself:
```ignorelang
usage: __main__.py [-h] [--verify] [-V] [--noverbose] [-F] [-D DOXYFILE]
                   [-P POSTPROCESS] [--listpostprocesses] [--debug | --mute]
                   [--nocleanup] [--skipgen]
                   translation_dir
```

#### Positional arguments
- `translation_dir`: The translations folder explained above.

#### Optional arguments
- `-h`: prints this usage message
- `--verify`: verifies the layout of the translations folder and all files inside, instead of actually generating the 
documentation
- `-V` (or `--version`): prints the version then exits.
- `--noverbose`: no output will be printed in the console.
- `-F` (or `--nofileprefix`): Deactivates the file prefixes when registering `doc_id`s.
- `-D` (or `--doxyfile`): Path to a custom Doxyfile. If this option is not provided, DoxyTH will look for a file 
named `Doxyfile` by default. Passing this option is necessary only when your Doxygen configuration file is 
NOT named `Doxyfile`
- `-P` (or `--postprocess`): Passes the file lines to a postprocess instead of printing them back to Doxygen.
- `--listpostprocesses`: Lists all the available postprocesses, then exits.
- [`--debug` | `--mute`]: `debug` prints everything, including non-error from the Doxygen output, whereas `mute` totally
mutes Doxygen, including the warnings and errors (and also those of DoxyTH itself). Both are NOT recommended unless
you perfectly know what you are doing.
- `--nocleanup`: Leaves the temporary files upon finishing generating the documentation. You shouldn't be using this
option unless you know why you use it.
- `--skipgen`: Debug option. Skips the Doxygen docs generation. DO NOT use unless you know how to.
