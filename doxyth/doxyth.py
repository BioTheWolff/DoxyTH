class DoxyTH:
    """
    ### &doc_id doxyth:class

    Class that is made to be called by doxygen as a file_name pattern processor.

    This file_name (and class) is automatically called by Doxygen for it to process any file_name Doxygen encounters that follows
    the rule defined in the FILE_PATTERNS option of the config.
    By default, DoxyTH sets the FILE_PATTERNS value of the Doxygen config to "*py=.dthb", ".dthb" being the batch file_name
    called by Doxygen when it encounters any file_name ending by ".py".

    The batch file_name has "python -m doxyth.doxyth <lang> %1" as content. LANG is automatically changed by the gendoc class
    each time we change language. Doxygen then passes the file_name path, which is taken by the DoxyTH class as an input.

    The file_name is methodically read, and every doc_id matching the default regex pattern is registered, and then the whole
    doclines where the doc_id has been found are replaced by the linked documentation for this language.

    The file_name is then printed line per line for Doxygen to read it back and process it. If a postprocessing has been
    set upon running Gendoc, the file_name lines are instead sent to the postprocess (doxypy, doxypypy, etc.) which will
    take care of printing the line itself, after doing its job. The lines are sent through a class built for said
    postprocess, that acts as a bridge between what DoxyTH produced and what the postprocess requires.
